            <li><strong>Antifragile/Robustness (243)</strong> - Systems or entities that benefit from disorder or shocks, becoming stronger or more resilient in the face of adversity.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Bayes' Theorem (244)</strong> - A mathematical theorem describing how to update probabilities based on new evidence or information.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Black Swan Event (245)</strong> - Rare and unpredictable events with significant impact, often overlooked in traditional statistical models.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Central Limit Theorem (246)</strong> - The principle that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Clustering Illusion (247)</strong> - Perceiving patterns or clusters in random data where none actually exist, due to the human tendency to find order.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Conditional Probability (248)</strong> - The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Confidence Interval (249)</strong> - A range of values around an estimate that is likely to contain the true value with a certain level of confidence.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Confounding Factor (250)</strong> - An extraneous variable that affects the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in a study.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Correlation & Causation (251)</strong> - Correlation between two variables does not imply causation, as other factors may be influencing the relationship.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Data Dredging (252)</strong> - Mining large datasets to find patterns or relationships, often leading to false discoveries due to multiple comparisons.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Distributions (253)</strong> - Mathematical functions that describe the probability of various outcomes in a sample space.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Error Bars (254)</strong> - Graphical representations showing the variability or uncertainty in a measurement or estimate.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Expected Value (255)</strong> - The long-term average or mean outcome of a random variable, weighted by its probability of occurrence.</li>
        
            <li><strong>False Negative (256)</strong> - Incorrectly concluding that something did not happen when it actually did (Type II error).</li>
        
            <li><strong>False Positive (257)</strong> - Incorrectly concluding that something happened when it actually did not (Type I error).</li>
        
            <li><strong>Fat-Tailed Distributions (258)</strong> - Probability distributions with higher probabilities of extreme events or outliers compared to a normal distribution.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Forcing Function (259)</strong> - An event or factor that directly influences or drives a particular outcome or behavior.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Game Theory (260)</strong> - The study of strategic decision-making among rational actors, often used in economics and political science.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Law of Large Numbers (261)</strong> - The principle that the average of a large number of independent trials will converge to the true expected value.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Mean/Median/Mode (262)</strong> - Measures of central tendency in a dataset representing, respectively, the average, middle value, and most frequent value.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Meta Analyses (263)</strong> - Statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple studies to provide a more comprehensive overview.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Monte Carlo Simulation (264)</strong> - Computational techniques using random sampling to model and analyze complex systems or processes.</li>

            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (266)</strong> - The default assumption in hypothesis testing, suggesting that there is no significant difference or effect.</li>
        
            <li><strong>P-Values (267)</strong> - The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Power Law (268)</strong> - A mathematical relationship between two quantities where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional change in the other.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Probability Distribution (269)</strong> - A mathematical function that assigns probabilities to the possible outcomes of a random variable.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Randomized Controlled Experiments (270)</strong> - Experimental studies where participants are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups to test interventions.</li>
