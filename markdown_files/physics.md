            <li><strong>Butterfly Effect (1)</strong> - Small changes can have large, unforeseen consequences.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Catalysts (2)</strong> - Substances that speed up chemical reactions without being consumed themselves.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Center of Gravity (3)</strong> - The point where the entire mass of an object is concentrated.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Chaos Theory (4)</strong> - The study of complex, dynamic systems that exhibit unpredictable behavior.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Critical Mass (5)</strong> - The minimum amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Entropy (6)</strong> - A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Frame of Reference (7)</strong> - A coordinate system used to describe the motion of objects.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (8)</strong> - The principle that states the fundamental limits on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Inertia (9)</strong> - The tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Le Chatelier's Principle (10)</strong> - When a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will adjust to counteract the disturbance and restore equilibrium.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Momentum (11)</strong> - The quantity of motion possessed by an object.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Peak (12)</strong> - The highest point or maximum value of something.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Potential Energy (13)</strong> - Energy that is stored in an object due to its position or configuration.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Reciprocity (14)</strong> - The principle of mutual exchange or give-and-take.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Relativity (15)</strong> - The theory that describes the relationships between space, time, and gravity.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Resonant Frequency (16)</strong> - The natural frequency at which an object vibrates most strongly.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Velocity (17)</strong> - The rate of change of an object's position with respect to time.</li>
